#   BERG

## Description

The BERG web page uses the users location to determine the current weather in the area. Another target destination can be added by the user for which directions will be created.

- The motivation behind this app was to help users get to where they are travelling while also being aware of the current weather conditions
- BERG helps save time and money by users not getting lost
